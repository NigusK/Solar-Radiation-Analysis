# Solar Radiation Analysis App

## Overview

The Solar Radiation Analysis App is a data visualization and analysis tool designed to help understand solar radiation patterns and other related environmental metrics form solar radiation location selection. It is part of the **Solar Radiation Analysis** project and is built using modern data analysis and visualization libraries.

## Features

- Import and process solar radiation data from multiple sites.
- Perform statistical analysis on key parameters, including:
  - Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI)
  - Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI)
  - Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI)
  - Ambient Temperature (Tamb)
- Generate interactive visualizations to support site selection for solar farm deployment.
- Analyze wind speed, temperature, precipitation, and other environmental variables.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual environment tools (optional but recommended)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
